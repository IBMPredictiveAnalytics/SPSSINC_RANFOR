# SPSSINC RANFOR
## Estimate random forest
 This procedure builds random forests of classification or regression trees.  It also supports unsupervised mode, in which case   proximities are calculated.  The companion procedure SPSSINC RANPRED calculates predictions for new data using the forest built by this procedure.  Note: this version is a major rewrite of the older SPSSINC RANFOR procedure and no longer requires the Python plug-in.
