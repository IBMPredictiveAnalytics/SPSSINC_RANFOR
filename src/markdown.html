<p>SPSSINC RANFOR /HELP.  prints this information and does nothing else.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>SPSSINC RANFOR DEPENDENT=mpg ENTER=engine weight
ID = caseid.
</code></pre>

<p>Split files and weight are not honored by this command.</p>

<p><strong>DEPENDENT</strong> and <strong>ENTER</strong> specify the dependent and independent
variable names.
Categorical  variables are automatically converted
appropriately to factors.  If the dependent variable is categorical,
classification is performed; otherwise regression is done.</p>

<p><strong>UNSUPERVISED</strong> = YES can be used to analyze proximities among the cases.
The dependent variable can be omitted in this case.  However,
if a dependent variable is used, the output automatically includes 
the MDS plot.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>MISSING</strong> controls missing value behavior.  The choices are:</p>

<ul>
RFIMPUTE may not be used if UNSUPERVISED=YES.<br/></li>
<li>ROUGH causes missing values to be imputed for all variables.<br/>
Scale variables are imputed as the variable median, and categorical variables 
as the mode with ties broken at random.<br/></li>
<li>RFIMPUTE causes a forest to be used to impute missing values in predictors.  
The dependent variable may not have missing values.
<p>From the underlying package documentation...<br>
The algorithm starts by imputing NAs using the rough method. Then the forest is estimated with the completed data. The proximity matrix from the forest is used to update the imputation of the NAs. For continuous predictors, the imputed value is the weighted average of the non-missing obervations, where the weights are the proximities. For categorical predictors, the imputed value is the category with the largest average proximity. This process is iterated 
several times.</p>
<li>FAIL stops the procedure if missing values are encountered.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NUMTREES</strong> specifies the number of trees to use and defaults to 500.</p>

<p><strong>VARSSAMPLED</strong> specifies the number of variables to consider at each 
node split.  It defaults to the number of predictors/3 for a scale dependent 
variable and sqrt(number of predictors) for a categorical variable.</p>

<p><strong>CLASSPRIORS</strong> applies only to classification and specifies priors for each
dependent variable category listed in ascending category order.<br/>
The values need not sum to 1.</p>

<p><strong>MINNODESIZE</strong> specifies the minimum size of terminal nodes in the tree.<br/>
It defaults to 5 for regression and 1 for classification.</p>

<p><strong>RANDOMNUMBERSEED</strong> sets the random number seed for
reproducibility from run to run.  This affects only the R random number
generator.</p>

<h2>SAVE</h2>

<p><strong>FOREST</strong> saves the actual R randomForest structure in an R workspace in the 
specified file (typically with extension Rdata).  This option or RETAINFOREST should 
be used if predictions are to be made with SPSSINC RANFOR PREDICT.  Predictions
cannot be made if UNSUPERVISED=YES</p>

<p>By default, the forest data structure is deleted from memory after results are produced.
Use <strong>RETAINFOREST</strong> to keep the data structure in memory.  This is useful if
proceeding to prediction with new data in the same session.  The data structure
will be replaced if this command is rerun.</p>

<p>
Using a case id variable for the output datasets is important if you plan to merge the results with the input dataset.
<p class="bullet">&bull;&nbsp;The dataset names must not already be in use.</p>
</p>

<p><strong>IMPUTEDDATASET</strong> names a dataset to be created with the data values after imputation.
If no imputation is done but an imputed dataset name is specified, the data values 
will be the same as the original data apart from any filter in effect.  Value labels and 
missing value definitions are not applied but can be brought over using APPLY DICTIONARY.</p>

<p><strong>PREDVALUES</strong> names a dataset to be created with the predicted values.  
This is not available if UNSUPERVISED=YES</p>

<p><strong>OUTLIERS</strong> names a dataset to be created with an outlier measure for each case in the 
analysis.  It is only available for classification analysis.  The measure is
n / sum(squared proximity), normalized by subtracting the median and divided by 
the MAD, within each class.  The proximity matrix is of order n**2 where n is the number
of cases, so use this option with caution.  If a dependent variable is
not specified, which requires UNSUPERVISED=YES, all cases are considered
to be in the same class.  If a dependent variable is specified, even if
UNSUPERVISED=YES, it defines classes used for calculating this measure.</p>

<h2>PRINT</h2>

<p>The default Viewer output includes a summary table, the Variable Importance table, 
and a plot of error rates versus the number of trees.  Additional output available is
<strong>VARUSAGE</strong>, which shows the frequency of usage of each predictor variable in 
the forest.  The error rate plot is not available if UNSUPERVISED=YES.</p>

<h2>PLOT</h2>

<p><strong>VARIABLEIMPORTANCE</strong> plots the variable importance</p>

<p><strong>PARTIALPLOTS</strong> shows the marginal effect of the specified variables on the 
response or the class probability.
It can be ALL to plot all predictors or a list of predictors.
Not available if UNSUPERVISED=YES.</p>

<p><strong>MDSPLOT</strong> specifies whether or not to plot case proximities.  This
is only available if there is a categorical dependent variable.  For
a large dataset, a lot of memory is required.</p>

<p><strong>MDSPLOTDIM</strong> specifies the number of dimensions for the plot.
The default value is 2.</p>
